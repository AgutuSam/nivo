    Nivo dendogram graph.
    
    For now this component doesn't support labels, but that's something
    you can implement via a custom layer.
    
    While it's part of the nivo internals, and not formally documented,
    you could use the `useDendogram` hook directly in order to build
    a fully custom component, this hook takes a config object which
    is very close to the component's props.
